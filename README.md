#TeamCity Commit Hooks Plugin 
[![plugin status](

This plugin allows installing GitHub webhooks for GitHub repositories used by TeamCity VCS roots. At the moment the plugin does three things:
* it shows a suggestion to install a GitHub webhook if it finds a GitHub repository in a project without such a webhook
* it provides a new action in the project 'Actions' menu for webhook installation enabling you to install or reinstall a webhook at any time
* it checks the status of all of the installed webhooks and raises a warning via the health report if some problem is detected

The plugin also installs webhook automatically when a build configuration is created via a URL or GitHub integration and uses a repository from GitHub Enterprise. 

The plugin is compatible with TeamCity 10.0 or later.
